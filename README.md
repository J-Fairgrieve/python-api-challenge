# Python API Challenge
### A homework assignment from the University of Birmingham Data Analytics Bootcamp (December 2021)

The aim of this project was to analyse [how the weather changes](https://github.com/J-Fairgrieve/python-api-challenge/blob/main/WeatherPy.ipynb) as you get closer to the equator and highlight [the best places to go on holiday](https://github.com/J-Fairgrieve/python-api-challenge/blob/main/VacationPy.ipynb) using the data. The challenge highlights the following skills:
 - API querying
 - Data Modelling
 - Plot Creation
 - Data Analysis
 - Usage of Google Maps

## Observations
 - As observed in both the northern & southern hemisphere charts vs. max temperature, the closer the latitude is to zero (the equator), the higher the max temperature.
 - Latitude appears to have no impact on the cloudiness percentage of a city
 - Wind speed also appears unaffected by the latitude, usually staying between 0-20mph. However, there are a few cities in the higher latitude sections of the northern hemisphere that can potentially reach speeds over 50mph

## Created Google Maps
